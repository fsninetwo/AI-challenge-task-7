COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED
-------------------------------

BEFORE (Original State):
- Overall Coverage: 48.64%
- Failed Tests: 65 out of 159 tests
- Modules with 0% Coverage: 2 (AIStrategy.js, Observers.js)
- Low Coverage Modules: 4 (Commands.js 28%, Game.js 37%)

===============================================================================

REMAINING ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------

🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
1. GameConfig immutability test - Object.freeze implementation
2. GameStates integration - State transition parameter handling
3. Game constructor - InputValidator instantiation
4. Integration tests - Event counting corrections

📈 COVERAGE ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Game.js - Add more integration scenarios (target: 70%+)
2. Error handling - Expand edge case testing
3. Performance - Add stress testing scenarios
4. End-to-end - Complete game flow validation

🏗️ TECHNICAL DEBT:
1. Mock inconsistencies between test files
2. Console output suppression standardization
3. Test isolation improvements
4. Async operation handling
